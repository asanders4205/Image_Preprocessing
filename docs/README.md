# Image Classification #

## This project will be a complete end-to-end data pipeline for Computer Vision, including: ##

### Preprocessing (DONE) ###
### Image Quality Classification ###
### Edge Detection ###
### Object Recognition ###

The sample data I used for preprocessing is the BIQ2021 dataset found here on Kaggle:\
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nisarahmedrana/biq2021


Uses python 3.9+ 

## Next Steps
CI\CD
Make portable to other operating systems and python versions 
Edge detection, train a model to recognize the contents of images


## To get started ##
Activate a virtual environment if you so choose \
Ensure you are using python 3.9+ \
Create a 'data' folder in your project directory \
In your terminal run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install requirements \
Execute the code to download the dataset via this line\
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("nisarahmedrana/biq2021") 

README will be updated as the project moves along


## Future expansions ##
- Compatibility with image datasets outside of Kaggle

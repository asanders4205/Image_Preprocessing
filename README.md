'''Define the goal of this project
The goal of this project is to classify images based on their quality, 
using various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms
'''

''' Data Mining Process
Selection:  identify and collect relevant data.
Preprocessing:  clean and handle missing/noisy data.
Transformation:  normalize, reduce, or engineer features.
Data Mining:  apply algorithms (classification, clustering, etc.).
Evaluation:  assess results, interpret patterns.
Knowledge/Deployment:  use insights in decision-making.

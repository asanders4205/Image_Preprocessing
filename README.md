# Image Quality Classifier #

## The goal of this process is to preprocess images to prepare them for use in a model ##

Programmed using the BIQ2021 dataset found on Kaggle here:\
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nisarahmedrana/biq2021


Uses python 3.9+ \

## Next Steps
Edge detection, train a model to recognize the contents of images


## To get started ##
Activate a virtual environment if you so choose \
Ensure you are using python 3.9+ \
Create a 'data' folder in your project directory \
In your terminal run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install requirements \
Execute the code to download the dataset via this line\
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("nisarahmedrana/biq2021") \

README will be updated as the project moves along


## Future expansions ##
- Compatibility with image datasets outside of Kaggle
